# Arduinio-Based-Lie-Detector
This is a simple lie detector project. The working principle lies in the assumption that a person while lying sweats from his/her fingertips. The circuit involved here is able to detect that moisture and glow leds based on the moisture content.

# Circuitry
1. Going as per code, connect digital pins 2,3,4 off arduino uno to 3 different coloured leds respectively.
2. Connect a wire to A0 pin and another wire to ground.
3. Attach those 2 wires on your fingertip seperated by a small distance.
4. Power on your arduino and test the circuit.


Note: The lie detection in this circuit purely relies on the amount of sweat generated from fingetips irrespective of truth or lies spoken. It is the assumption
that the person taking the test will sweat only upon lying. It may not be so. Hence the accuracy of this project is not sufficient for real time appications.
